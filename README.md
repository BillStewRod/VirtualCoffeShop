# Virtual Coffee Barista

This is a fun little project that i created. Is a virtual Coffee Barista that you can order you coffee, with a twist.

For some reason the Barista hates anyone with the name Alison, she thinks they are all evil, but if you have done more than 4 good deeds then you can proceed and order your coffee.

Also she likes beards as long as they are 2 inches or longer in length.

This project started when i was learning Python using the [NetworkChuckAcademy](https://learn.networkchuck.com/)  where he teaches how to write code creating a simple virtual barista. From there i kept making adjustments and additions. Then converted to work as a web app using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), host on [Render](https://render.com) using the free tier and [Cron-Job](https://cron-job.org/en/) to keep website from going to sleep.
