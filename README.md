##Virtual Coffee Barista

This is a fun little project that i created. Is a virtual Coffee Barista athat you can order you coffee, with a twist.

For some reason the Barista hates anyone with the name Alison, she thinks they are all evil, but if you have done more than 4 good deeds then you can proceed and order your coffee.

Also she likes beards as long as they are 2 inches or longer in length.

This project started when i was learning Python using the [NetworkChuckAcademy](https://learn.networkchuck.com/) where he teaches how to write code creating a simple virtaul barista. From there i kept making adjustments and adittions. Then i got into Streamlit and converted to work as a web app using Streamlit
